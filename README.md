## Features

1. **Ripple Animation**:
   - A dynamic ripple effect that expands and fades when the button is rendered.
   - The animation runs infinitely unless the button is hovered over or focused.

2. **Hover and Focus Effects**:
   - The button changes color and elevates slightly when hovered or focused.
   - The ripple animation and background effects are disabled during hover or focus for a clean appearance.

3. **Gradient Background**:
   - A gradient background that transitions smoothly from dark purple to deep blue, giving the button a polished, modern look.

4. **Responsiveness**:
   - The button is styled with flexible dimensions and properties to adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions.
